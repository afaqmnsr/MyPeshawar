	Pashtun culture is based on Islam and Pashtunwali, which is an ancient way of life, as well as speaking of the Pashto language and wearing Pashtun dress. The culture of the Pashtun people is highlighted since at least the time of Herodotus (484–425 BC) or Alexander the Great, when he explored the Afghanistan and Pakistan region in 330 BC. The Pashtun culture has little outside influence, and, over the ages, has retained a great degree of purity.
Peshawar is the centre of Ghandara (Hindko) culture and arts in Pakistan.
 With the Soviet war in Afghanistan in the 1980s and the influx of Afghan refugees 
into Pakistan, Peshawar became home for many Afghan musicians and artists.The city 
has become the centre for Pashto music and cinema as well Persian music for the 
Tajiks. There is also a thriving book publishing activity in the Persian language 
in Peshawar, concentrated primarily on Islamic Shia literature&nbsp;and located in
 the Qissa Khawani Bazaar.However, the election of the Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal (MMA)
 Islamic coalition in 2002 resulted in restrictions on public musical performances,
 as well as a ban on playing recorded music on public transports. Peshawar has 
become host to a thriving underground scene.In 2008, the secular Awami National 
Party (ANP) swept elections and won power from the Islamic coalition. Since then,
 some restrictions have been lifted, but there has not been a full restoration of 
the liberties guaranteed before the MMA victory in 2002.
The historic old city of Peshawar was once a heavily guarded citadel with high 
walls. Today, not much remains of the walls, but the houses and havelis have an 
essence of days gone by. Most of the houses are made of unbaked bricks with wooden 
structures for protection against earthquakes. Many of them have beautifully 
carved wooden doors and latticed wooden balconies. Areas such as Sethi Mohallah 
still contain many fine examples of the old architecture of Peshawar. There are 
many historic monuments and bazaars in the Old city, including the Mohabbat Khan 
Mosque and Kotla Mohsin Khan, Chowk Yadgar and the Qissa Khawani Bazaar. This part 
of inner Peshawar has been damaged by rapid growth and development and is in need of
 urgent protection.The walled city was surrounded by several main gates which served
 as the main entry points into the city, some of which still survive today. 
They include: Lahori Gate, Sarasia Gate, Ganj Gate, Sirki Gate, Sard Chah Gate,
 Kohati Gate Former Gates which were demolished during wars were Kabuli Gate,
 Berikian Gate, Bajori Gate, Yakatut Gate, Dabgari Gate, Kachahri Gate,
 and Hasht Nagri Gate.</b></p>

Afghanistan and K.P.K. were noted for its poetic language even before the Islamic conquest of Afghanistan. The Pata Khazana contains Pashto poetry written as far back as the 8th century. Some notable poets from the region of Afghanistan-Pakistan include Amir Kror Suri, Khushal Khan Khattak, Rahman Baba, Nazo Tokhi, Ahmad Shah Durrani, Timur Shah Durrani, Shuja Shah Durrani, Ghulam Muhammad Tarzi, and Khan Abdul Ghani Khan.[2]

Pashtun men usually gather at special events and listen to Pashto poetry. There are TV programs which broadcast such events to the wider Pashtun audiences. One such program is on AVT Khyber channel in Pakistan, with Amanullah Kakar as the presenter.

Abdur Rahmān Mohmand (1632–1706) or Rahmān Bābā, was a renowned Pashtun Sufi Dervish and poet from Peshawar in the Mughal Empire (modern-day Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan). He, along with his contemporary Khushal Khan Khattak, is considered one of the most popular poets among the Pashtuns in Pakistan and Afghanistan.His poetry expresses a peaceful mystical side of local culture which is becoming increasingly threatened by less tolerant interpretations of Islam.

Traditional Pashto music is mostly klasik ghazals, using Rabab or sitar, tabla, portable harmonium, flute and several other musical instruments.

Below is a list of the main known styles of Attan in Pakistan and Afghanistan. All of these may be practiced and mixed by Pashtuns in other valleys, and it's not uncommon to see Pashtuns of one province being better at a different region's style.Pashto: اALA-LC Romanization: Ataṇ, also referred to as Atan or Attan, are the following:</b>

<h2 id="things1">Attan Dance:</h2>
<p  id="culture"><b>
In this dance, the dancers perform to the beat of the music. It is typically performed by men and women. It involves 2–5 steps, ending with a clap given while facing the center, after which the process is repeated. The hips and arms are put in a sequential movement including left and right tilts, with the wrists twisting in sequence. Ultimately a hand is projected outward and brought in a 'scoop-like' fashion towards the center where the other hand meets it for a clap. This dance is typically performed with the musician dictating the duration and speed.</b></p>

<h2 id="things1">Khattak Dance:</h2>
<p  id="culture"><b>
A group of dancers performing Khattak dance in Pakistan
The Khattak dance is performed by the Khattak tribe, mainly in Pakistan but also in some eastern parts of Afghanistan.</b>
</p>

<h2 id="things1">Mahsud Attan (Dance):</h2>
<p id="culture"><b>
This is a unique dance routine using rifles performed by the Mahsud tribe of Pashtuns in South Waziristan. Originally it was performed at times of war, but later became a cultural dance. The dancers dance empty handed and require only large drums. Nowadays it is performed with guns in the dancers' hands; loaded guns are taken in one hand, and to the beat of the drum the dancers move forward in a circle. After taking two and a half steps, each dancer turns about and cocks the gun. All the dancers do this in a uniform manner, and by completing the turning steps they fire in the air simultaneously. The sound of the guns seems to be a single big bang.</b></p>

<h2 id="things1">Waziri Dance:</h2>
<p id="culture"><b>
Waziristan, a region of Federally Administered Tribal Areas of Pakistan, is a large area and has a particular Pashtun culture. Two drummers and a flute player play a particular tune. All the Wazirs stand around them. Two people leave the circle, go dancing towards the drummers, and come back dancing in the same manner. While performing, both people turn around twice, once facing each other, and once facing the opposite direction. After doing this separately, they march while dancing to the assembled crowd. As they reach the circle, another pair of performers move forward in the same fashion.
