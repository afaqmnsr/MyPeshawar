<p>A warm welcome to the City of flowers. The City District Government of Peshawar is making efforts to providing cutting-edge and fringe development and social prospects including tranquil Metropolitan lifestyle, better sanitation, recreational spaces, health, transportation, improvement of local economy and preservation of indigenous heritage remain core priorities of the City District Government. I strongly believe in a direct citizens participation in decision-making with particular focus on youth who produce innovative ideas which are crucial for achieving these benchmarks and this is what the City District Government aims to foster. Nature has bestowed Peshawar with numerous potential while this office will make every effort in collaboration with the provincial government to provide an enabling environment for taping the resources, investment and facilitation of business to improve the local economy.
<br>
I as Nazim will leave no stone unturned in achieving goals of the City Government in a way it serve the citizens in a most accomplished fashion.

Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is blessed with an abundance of nature’s wealth. From some of the world’s highest peaks in the Hindukush in the north — to the deserts of the Dera Ismail Khan in the south; and from the historic Khyber Pass in the west to the lovely banks of River Indus at Attock in the east our land has abundant attractions to offer for every type of tourist. Our culture is thousands of years old and , extremely rich. Moreover, our people are exceedingly hospitable; they are warm and courteous and take much delight in entertaining guests. We take great pride in our timeless traditions and values. As inhabitants of a province often called the ‘Land of Hospitality’, I believe that tourism can play the chief role in projecting a positive and friendly image of the region. Since time immemorial, our lofty mountains, scenic valleys and plains, lush forests and meadows, historical monuments and rich traditions have been valued for their beauty. I would like to recommend that you continue surfing our website to find useful and accurate tourism information. I look forward to your feedback so if you have any views or suggestions, please pass them on to us via our feedback form. I warmly welcome you all to the beautiful Khyber Pakhtunkwa.<br><br> Riaz Khan Mahsud  - Deputy Commissioner Peshawar</p>
